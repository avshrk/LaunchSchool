## Objects
* What do JavaScript objects contain ?
* What are methods ? How do they differ from functions ?



* Create a greeter object with function morning which prints 'Good Morning'.
* Invoke morning function both as a method and a function.



* What is the value of `this` ?


* Create a counter object with count property, and advance method.
* Increase the count property by invoking advance method.
